        competition is really tough, Taiwander is struggling and needs your

        the Yuruchara Grand Prix website. It's all in Japanese, but it's very
        easy after you've done it once. We've written some instructions to help. <br style="clear:both"/></p>

        <p><strong>What is Taiwander?</strong><br>

        Taiwander is lives in Japan, here is its biography. It's a volunteer
        with the Cheer4Taiwan organisation working to promote the beautiful
        island of Taiwan to Japan! Taiwander isn't connected to the government
        or any business.  Let's watch this video to see Taiwander dancing live
        to its theme song,<br>"Taiwan the Tropical Island" (written and sung by
        Kenta Ebara).<br>

        <p><strong>Why is Taiwander struggling in the YuruChara Grand Prix?</strong><br>

        Most people in Japan give their vote to their own local character and
        business characters are supported by their company. Taiwander is in the
        'overseas character' category, competing against characters working for
        foreign governments (and 7-11!). Taiwander needs support from people in
        Taiwan, but even though it loves Taiwan very much it's very shy about
        speaking Taiwanese!

        <p><strong>Who are you?</strong><br>
        We're just fans who want to help Taiwander! We're not affiliated with
        Cheer4Taiwan or any other organisation in Japan or Taiwan.

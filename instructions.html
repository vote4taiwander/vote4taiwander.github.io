        <h3>How to Vote for Taiwander!</h3>

        <p>There are six steps to get started but after you vote once it's much
        easier! If you read Japanese, then the original instructions are
        <a href="http://www.yurugp.jp/vote/method.php">here</a>. 
        
        <p>Don't understand Japanese? No problem, it's still easy, let's go!</p>

        <h4>Step 1:</h4> First you need an email address that <i>is not from gmail or
        Yahoo</i>. Send a blank email (no text, no subject) to this address: <tt>entry@vote.yurugp.jp</tt>

        <h4>Step 2:</h4> A reply will come back very quickly. Got it? Click on the
        link. You need to choose a password. There are two boxes, type your password
        in each box and click the button underneath to create your account.<br>

        <h4>Step 3:</h4> OK, we've done the registration. Time to vote for
        Taiwander! Go to <a
        href=http://www.yurugp.jp/vote/detail.php?id=00002543>Taiwander's
    page</a>. The numbers at the top tell you Taiwander's entry number (116),
overall rank, rank among non-commercial characters and number of points.<br>To
vote, click on the big yellow button!<br> 
        
        <img width=300px src='./images/votebutton.png'/>

        <h4>Step 4:</h4> To vote we need to log in (ログイン)!<br>
        
        <img src='./images/step4_login.png'/>

        Put your email address in the first box and your password in the second
        box. That's easy! Now is the real challenge! You need to type in the
        letters in the picture, but they are in Japanese <a>hiragana writing</a>!<br>  

        If you know some Japanese already or shop on Japanese websites this
        will be OK. But if not don't panic!

        Fill in the five characters and click the <img height=12pt src='./images/lastbutton.png'/> button.

        <h4>Arigato!</h4> You've voted for Taiwander! Thanks!<br>

        <img width=70% src='./images/logout.png'/>

        After voting you can choose to log out (maybe someone with a different
        email wants to vote with your computer...?). But you don't have to. If you
        don't log out, you will be able to vote again tomorrow without having
        to fill in the Japanese captcha again.

        Remember, it's a race! Taiwander needs to keep going up or it will go
        down! One vote each day up to 2015年11月16日 (18時), please!
